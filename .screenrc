### Example Code To Help When Tweaks Are Needed ###

# Time
# caption always "%Y-%m-%d %c:%s"

# Time, aligned right
# caption always "%=%Y-%m-%d %c:%s"

# Time, aligned right, surrounded by brackets
# caption always "%=[%Y-%m-%d %c:%s]"

# Time, aligned right, surrounded by brackets, in green text with no bg, reset the formatting at the end
# caption always "%{= kG}%=[%Y-%m-%d %c:%s]%{-}"

# Current tab number and current tab title
# caption always "%n (%t)"

# System load
# caption always "%l"

# Hostname in brackets with green text
# caption always "%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}]"

# Hostname aligned left, time aligned right
# caption always "%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}] %{= kG} %= [%Y-%m-%d %c:%s]%{-}"

# Window list
# caption always "%w"

# List of windows before current, info on current tab in brackets, lists of window after current
# caption always "%-Lw [%f%n %t] %+Lw"

# Working example with left aligned scrolling window list and right aligned static positioned info
# http://serverfault.com/questions/15704/right-aligning-text-in-gnu-screen-caption-or-hardstatusline
# caption always "%{= Kw} %-Lw%{= KW}[%50>%n%f* %t]%{= Kw}%+Lw%-30=| %l | %H"

# My end result. Auto-expanding not cut off vimrc window list and static info on the right
# 22 is an exact measurement of the space needed for the info statically positioned to the right
caption always "%{= KG} %-Lw%{= KW}[%50>%n%f* %t]%{= KG}%+Lw %-22=| %Y-%m-%d %c:%s "
